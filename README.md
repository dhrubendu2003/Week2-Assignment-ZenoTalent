Overview
This assignment involves creating and populating several tables to represent a project management scenario. It then requires writing SQL queries using various techniques like Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, correlated subqueries, and joins to extract specific insights from the data.

How to Run
1. Ensure you have access to a SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. Open your SQL client or command-line interface.
3. Create a database (if necessary) and select it.
4. Copy the contents of assignment_week2.sql.
5. Paste and execute the script in your SQL environment. This will create the tables, insert the data, and run all the queries.
